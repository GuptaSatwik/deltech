        event that is designed to exhaustively test each
        and every aspect of our car. On the first day, we compete in the static events like Design, Cost and Business.
        On the second, after clearing the Tech Inspection, we participate in short dynamic events designed to wring
        out
        specific aspects of our carâ€™s performance. The final day of competition revolves around the endurance race,
        where every team goes wheel-to-wheel for a 4 hour test of endurance and durability.</h6>
